## Why Secure Environment Management Matters

Managing `.env` files by copy-pasting them around like a hot potato is fun‚Ä¶ until a secret lands in a public repo.
EnvShield solves the ‚Äúdotenv dumpster fire‚Äù by giving you **schema-first configuration**, automatic documentation, and built-in **secret scanning**‚Äîall wrapped in a workflow lazy enough for a 3 a.m. commit.


## Key Features of the EnvShield CLI

![Demo of EnvShield scanning secrets](.gif/scan.gif)

-   **Environment Variable Governance** ‚Äì One `env.schema.toml` file becomes your single source of truth.

-   **Open-Source Secret Scanner** ‚Äì Detects API keys, private keys, and other credentials _before_ you push.

-   **Local Development Workflow** ‚Äì Automatic `.env.example` syncing and onboarding that even future-you will thank you for.

-   **Git Pre-commit Hook** ‚Äì Blocks secret leaks faster than you can say `git push --force`.

-   **Configuration as Code** ‚Äì Your environment config is version-controlled and documented like real code.

_(Translation: EnvShield is that overprotective friend who checks the door lock five times so you can sleep.)_

## Installation
Requires **Python 3.10+**.
```bash
pip install envshield
envshield --help
```
 Done. Your project is now 72 % less combustible.

## The EnvShield Philosophy: Schema-First Configuration

EnvShield's power comes from a simple idea: your configuration should be treated like code. It introduces a single source of truth, the `env.schema.toml` file.

This file is a **"configuration contract"** that explicitly defines every environment variable your project needs. By defining your variables here, you get:

-   **Automated Documentation**: Your `.env.example` is always perfectly in sync with your schema.
-   **Ironclad Validation**: Catch typos and missing variables before you even run your app.
-   **Proactive Security**: A built-in scanner and Git hook **prevent secrets from ever being committed**.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Purpose | Demo |
|---|---|---|
| `envshield init` | Auto-detects framework, creates env.schema.toml, installs the Git hook. | ![Demo of EnvShield init](.gif/init.gif) |
| `envshield scan` | Scans files or staged commits for secrets. | ![Demo of EnvShield scan](.gif/scan.gif) |
| `envshield install-hook` | Manually install or update the Git pre-commit hook. | For when you skipped step one because YOLO. |
| `envshield check <file>` | Validates a local .env file against the schema. | ![Demo of EnvShield check](.gif/check.gif) |
| `envshield schema sync` | Regenerates .env.example from the schema. | ![Demo of EnvShield sync](.gif/sync.gif) |
| `envshield setup` | Interactive onboarding to create a local env. | ![Demo of EnvShield setup](.gif/setup.gif) |
| `envshield doctor` | Runs a full health check (and can auto-fix). | ![Demo of EnvShield check](.gif/check.gif) |


## Competitor Comparison: Choosing the Right Tool

A scanner is a smoke detector. A cloud vault is an off-site bank. **EnvShield is the fireproof, self-organizing house you should have been living in all along.** It provides the complete local workflow that developers need to prevent secret leaks in the first place.

| **Streamlining Developer Onboarding** | ‚úÖ **Automated**.

| **Preventing Configuration Drift**    | ‚úÖ **Solved**.

| **Primary Focus**                     | **Complete Local Workflow**. Manages files, documents schemas, validates setups, and scans for leaks.        | **Secret Detection Engine.**                                     | **Cloud-Based Secret** Vault.                                                           | **Shell Environment Automation.** |

Think of scanners as smoke detectors and cloud vaults as off-site banks.
**EnvShield is the fire-proof, self-organizing house you should have been living in all along.**

## The Brains of the Operation: The Core Files

`envshield` is managed by two simple files you commit to your repository.

-   `env.schema.toml`: The source of truth. This is where you define every variable your project needs.

```
    # env.schema.toml

    [DATABASE_URL]
    description = "The full connection string for the PostgreSQL database."
    secret = true # Marks this as sensitive

    [LOG_LEVEL]
    description = "Controls the application's log verbosity."
    secret = false
    defaultValue = "info" # Provides a fallback
```

-   `envshield.yml`: The workflow config. In Phase 1, it's very simple and mainly points to your schema and defines scanner exclusions.

## Future Roadmap: Teams & Enterprise‚ú®

Phase 1 is the free, powerful "Local Guardian." But the journey doesn't end there. Upcoming paid tiers will turn `envshield` into a complete collaboration and automation platform.

### Phase 2: The Team Collaborator (Paid Tier)

-   `envshield use <profile>`: Instantly switch your entire project's configuration between different environments (e.g., `local`, `staging`).

-   `envshield onboard <profile>`: A supercharged `setup` that can also run scripts like` docker compose up` and database migrations for a true one-command setup.

-   `envshield share`: Securely share a secret with a teammate via an encrypted, one-time-use link.

-   `envshield docs`: Generate beautiful Markdown or HTML documentation from your schema.

### Phase 3: The Enterprise-Grade System (Paid Tier)

-   `envshield login`, `pull`, `push`: Full integration with a centralized, cloud-based secret vault.

-   `envshield export`: Securely inject secrets into your CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

-   **Audit Logs & RBAC**: A complete, compliant, and auditable history of all secret access and team permissions, managed through a web dashboard.
